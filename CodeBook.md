This file serves as the codebook for the dataset given in the tidytable.txt file

### List of Columns
This file contains the mean and standard deviation values of the following variables on X, Y and Z axes. 
These have been carried over from the original dataset.
- timeDomainBodyAccelerometer
- timeDomainGravityAccelerometer
- timeDomainBodyAccelerometerJerk
- timeDomainBodyGyro
- timeDomainBodyGyroJerk
- timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMag
- timeDomainGravityAccMag
- timeDomainBodyAccJerkMag
- timeDomainBodyGyroMag
- timeDomainBodyGyroJerkMag
- frequencyDomainBodyAccelerometer
- frequencyDomainBodyAccelerometerJerk
- frequencyDomainBodyGyro
- frequencyDomainBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
- frequencyDomainBodyAccJerkMagnitude
- frequencyDomainBodyGyroMagnitude
- frequencyDomainBodyGyroJerkMagnitude

Apart from these, two new columns called `subject` and `activity` have been created which denote the subjectID and the kind of activity 
the subject was performing while the measurements were being taken
